/// Window manager that manages concurrent direct IO writes.

/// A write would make a range of WAL data persistent. The range is represented
/// as [offset, offset + len). `io_uring` allows up to configured IO_DEPTH number of
/// writes submitted to underlying device and get them done concurrently regardless of
/// submit order, unless their SQEs are flagged with `IOSQE_IO_LINK` and within the
/// same submit batch.
///
/// To achieve maximum IOPS/throughput, we do not use linking requests and manage flush
/// progress manually.
///
/// Here is how we manage the concurrent window:
///
/// 1. On reaping a CQE, we add the range [offset, offset + len) into the completed tree map in form of offset --> len;
/// 1.1 If the completed range offset > committed, meaning the gap exists between the committed and the completed,
/// we just wait further completed ranges to advance the committed;
/// 1.2 If the completed range offset == committed, meaning the gap is closed, we advance the committed directly.
/// 1.3 If the completed range offset < committed, meaning we are expanding continuous writes, advance the committed as well.
