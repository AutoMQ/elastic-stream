/// Window manager that manages concurrent direct IO writes.
///
/// A write would make a range of WAL data persistent. The range is represented
/// as [offset, offset + len). `io_uring` allows up to configured IO_DEPTH number of
/// writes submitted to underlying device and get them done concurrently regardless of
/// submit order, unless their SQEs are flagged with `IOSQE_IO_LINK` and within the
/// same submit batch.
///
/// To achieve maximum IOPS/throughput, we do not use linking requests and manage flush
/// progress manually.
///
/// Here is how we manage the concurrent window:
///
/// 1. Once a SQE is generated and prepared to submit, we add the range [offset, offset + len)
///    into a tree map in form of offset --> len;
/// 2. On reaping a CQE, we compare the completed IO with the minimum node of submitted tree-map.
/// 2.1 If the completed range offset != committed, meaning we are not expanding continuous writes,
///     we insert it to completed tree map directly.
/// 2.2 If these two ranges are identical, and offset of them equals to the previously committed
///     , then increase the committed and we are safe to acknowledge all pending requests whose
///     spans are less than the committed.
/// 2.3  Once we found an expanding IO completion, we need to loop to advance more.
