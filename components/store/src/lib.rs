//! # Design Overview and Theory
//!
//! `store` crate follows "thread-per-core" paradigm to achieve the goal of scaling linearly with the addition and evolution of hardware.
//!  This design pattern makes execution of threads independent from one another as much as possible, which means avoiding software locks
//!  and even atomic instructions. Read [SPDK](https://spdk.io/doc/concurrency.html) for a detailed explanation and analysis.
//!
//! There are other libraries and products adopting this design:
//! - [Datadog Glommio](https://www.datadoghq.com/blog/engineering/introducing-glommio/)
//! - [ScyllaDB](https://www.scylladb.com/) and [Seastar](https://seastar.io/)
//! - [Redpanda](https://redpanda.com/blog/tpc-buffers)
//! - [SPDK](https://spdk.io/doc/concurrency.html)
//!
//! # Implementation
//! In production, this crate is supposed to run on Linux with modern kernel, offering full-fledged io-uring feature. It also works for macOS
//!  and legacy Linux where io-uring is not available through falling back to kqueue and epoll respectively.
//!
//! # Rust Note
//! `TAIT` feature is employed to wrap async methods into Future, which would then be wrapped into `tower`-like service and layers. As a result,
//! nightly rust-toolchain is required for the moment.
